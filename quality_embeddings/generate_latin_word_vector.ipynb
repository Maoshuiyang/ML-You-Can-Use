    "* for semantic property tasks, larger dimensions will lead to better performance \n",
    "* For most NLP tasks a dimensionality of 50 is typically sufficient.\n",
    "* ... multiple iterations are necessary.  The performance increases by a large margin when weiterate more than once, regardless of the task and the cor-pus. \n",
    "* Early stopping for regularization based on minimizing the validation loss isn't as useful as with other ML tasks; ideally a specific test would be implemented, but this is difficult to implement.\n"
